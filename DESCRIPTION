Description: The Structstrings package implements the widely used to bracket 
    annotation for storing base pairing information in structured RNA.
    Structstrings uses the infrastructure provided by the Biostrings package and 
    derives the DotBracketString and related classes from the BString class. 
    From these base pair table can be produced for in depth analysis. In 
    addition, the loop indices of the base pairs can be retrieved.
    For better efficiency information conversion is implemented in C, inspired 
    to a large extend by the ViennaRNA package.
